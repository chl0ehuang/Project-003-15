    "- Gender of Player (character):`gender` since the K-NN model calculates distances of the nearest neighbors to the unknown observation, gender includes descrete categories. While categorical variables could be converted to numeric values, this is not appropriate as there is no meaningful numeric relationship between categories such as Male and Female.\n",

    "The columns `hashedEmail`, `name` , and `gender` is removed as it is not relevant to our classsification model. The `Age` column is also renamed with lowercases allowing consistency between column names. Additionally, since the observations in `subscribe` are categories, the column type is changed to factor.\n",

    "After wrangling and tidying the data in the `players` object data frame, the data appears data as each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row, and each cell is a single measurment."
